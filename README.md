## Features

- Fully **self-contained**: just include a `<div>` and the script.
- **Interactive buttons** for thumbs up 👍 and thumbs down 👎.
- Easy to **customize styles** and text directly in the script.
- Can be extended to **send feedback data** to your server or API.
- **Responsive and lightweight**, works on any modern browser.

## Installation
